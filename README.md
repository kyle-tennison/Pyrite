# Pyrite

A 2D linear-elastic FEA program for isotropic materials, built in Python.

## Installation & Running

You can install pyrite with

```
pip install .
```

You will also need [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/#Download) installed on your machine.

Afterward, you can run pyrite with:

```
pyrite my_geom.svg input.json
```

For help with more commands, run:

```
pyrite -h
```

## About

I built Pyrite to learn more about the finite element method. It's aim isn't to be exceptionally performantâ€”it's mainly about getting all the pieces connected.

Pyrite takes the following steps to arrive at a static mechanical solution:

1. It first parses a `.svg` file into a list of vertices.
2. Using [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/), these vertices define the boundary of a 2D mesh.
3. Pyrite parses this mesh into a list of nodes and elements. It will apply boundary conditions from an input JSON file.
4. Each element calculates its stiffness matrix; these are then compiled into a total stiffness matrix
5. Using numpy's `linalg` module, Pyrite sets up the finite element equation and solves for unknown nodal forces and displacements.
6. The solution is plotted next to the initial model using matplotlib.

## Examples

This repo contains two examples in the `examples/` dir. 

## Limitations

- Python is slow, and moderately large models will solve very slowly. Pyrite is a prototype for a much more performant solver I am planning to build in Rust.

- Pyrite currently only supports **simply connected regions**, i.e., regions that have no "holes". This is an artifact of having a single list of vertices.

- Pyrite is only linear-elastic. Once stresses exceed the yield strength of the material, Pyrite will not accommodate plastic behavior

- There is no contact recognition, meaning that a part can clip within itself.

> Many more limitations are inherent with a single-part, 2D, isotropic linear-elastic static mechanical solver; the list above highlights the most restrictive of these.
